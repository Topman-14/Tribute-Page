# Fela Kuti Tribute-Page
This is one of my certification projects for the responsive web design course on @freecodecamp.org. 
It features a late popular Nigerian musician - Fela Kuti. currently, most of the text is taken 
straight from wikipedia to start it off.
In time I'll be adding more pages and musicians from all over the globe.
Also, I'll have to improve the functionality and design of the page
